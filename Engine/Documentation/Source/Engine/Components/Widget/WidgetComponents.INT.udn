Widget Components allow you to manifest 3D UI elements created through [**Unreal Motion Graphics**](Engine/UMG/UserGuide) in your game world. 

## Widget Component

The **WidgetComponent** itself is a 3D instance of a Widget Blueprint that you can interact with in your game world. 

In the example below, we have added a WidgetComponent which will now allow us to specify a Widget Class Blueprint.

_This example uses a Widget Blueprint to display a interactive menu that appears in the game world._

You can change settings to how the WidgetComponent is perceived in the world by changing the Draw Size or Max Interaction distance.

Once we place the Actor that contains our WidgetComponent in our level, our Widget Class Blueprint is displayed in the world.
