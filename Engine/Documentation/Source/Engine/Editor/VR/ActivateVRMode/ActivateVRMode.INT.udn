1. After the editor loads, click **File > New** and open up our new "VR-Basic" level.  This environment is a good playground for you to learn the controls.

1. In the Editor Preferences (**Edit > Editor Preferences**), select the **Experimental** category and choose **Enable VR Editing**.

1. To get into VR, click the **VR** button on the editor's main tool bar to activate VR Mode. Assuming your tracking space is properly calibrated, you should see a Tutorial window floating in front of you with some help.

	[REGION:tip]
	You can start directly into VR Mode by passing `-VREditor` on the command-line to UE4Editor.exe.

1. To use the tutorial, position the Controller over the section you want to read then squeeze the Controller trigger to open that section. 

At any time you can press the Home button to return to this menu and then select another help section.
