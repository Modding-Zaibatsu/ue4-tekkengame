%Steps%

Our first shot is complete, now we will take what we have learned and create an additional shot for our scene. 

This time we will push the camera in from the front of our character in on their face. 

## Steps

1.	In the **Content Browser**, select the **Shot01** Level Sequence then press **Shift+W** to duplicate it.

	Our Shot01 already has most of the existing content we will want to also use in our second shot. 

1.	Inside **Shot02**, delete the existing **CineCameraActor** then click the **Add Camera** button.

	This will automatically assign it on the Camera Cuts track and enter the camera in Pilot Mode. 

1.	Move the camera around to the front of the Skeletal Mesh Actor in the level.

	The name of your CineCameraActor may differ from above which is perfectly fine. 
	
1.	Select the **CineCameraActor** track in Sequencer, then press **S** to add a keyframe the Camera's Transform.

	Your value you might be different from above based on where you placed the camera. 

1.	Use the **To End** button in the Cinematic Preview to jump to the end of the Sequence. 

1.	Move the camera in on the character then add a keyframe (**S**) for the position.

1.	In the **Details** panel for the camera, use the **Eye Dropper** to focus in on the character then add a keyframe. 

	![](SequencerQS_4_6.png)

	You should have keyframes at the start for the initial position and focus value as well as at the end. 

1.	You can use the **Camera Lock** toggle button on the **Camera Cuts** track to enable the Cinematic Preview.

## End Result

We have set up our second shot of our sequence where the camera starts from far away and pushes in on the character. 

In our next step we will tie our shots together using the **Shot Track** in our Master Level Sequence. 
We will also create a **Take** (or variation) of one of our shots that we can quickly swap in or out. 
You will also see how we can arrange the order of shots in our scene as we get a little bit closer to finishing our sample scene.
