In the previous steps we created our shots, now we will tie them together using the **Shot Track** which allows you to add Level Sequences along the timeline for playback. 
We will also create a **Take** of one of those Shots, which will allow us to create a variant of that shot or use it as an additional Shot in the cinematic. 

At the end of this step, you will have created your own multi-shot cinematic with Sequencer! 

## Steps

1. In the **Content Browser** open the **Master** Level Sequence. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_1.png)

1. Inside the Level Sequence, click the **Add** button and select the **Shot Track**. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_2.png)

1. Click the **+ Shot** button and add **Shot01** to the track. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_3.png)

1. Add **Shot02** to the **Shot Track**. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_4.png)

	Notice that Shot02 extends past the red maker (which is the end of playback range). 
	You can drag the red marker to the end of Shot02 or automatically keep added sections within playback range by enabling the option in the **General Options** menu. 

1. Click the **General Options** button then select **Keep Playback Range in Section Bounds**. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_5.png)

	This will push the end marker out for us anytime we add content and will ensure that everything is within playback range. 

1. **Left-click** and drag **Shot02** down a level within the **Shot Track**. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_6.png)

	You can click-and-drag Shots around and arrange them on a Shot Track. 

1. Click the **Lock Viewport** toggle button to lock the camera to the **Shot Track**. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_7.png)

	Like the **Camera Cuts** Camera Lock button, the Shot Track will only affect the Cinematic Viewport. 

1. **Right-click** on **Shot02** then select the **New Take** option. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_8.png)

	A **Duplicate Asset As** window will appear, click **Save**. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_9.png)

	[REGION:note]
	Takes are automatically named. You can change the naming convention in the [](Engine/UI/ProjectSettings) under **Level Sequences**.  
	[/REGION]

1.	**Right-click** on the newly created Shot and choose **New Take** again. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_10.png)

	[REGION:note]
	When creating a Take it does not delete the Level Sequence but creates a duplicate of it which you can then alter. 
	Currently when creating a Take for the first time it replaces the Shot with the new Take (the original Shot still exists in the Content Browser but is not listed as a "Take" in the Takes Menu - see below). 
	[/REGION]

1.	**Right-click** on the newly created shot and highlight **Takes**. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_11.png)

	Above we are currently using **Take 3** in our cinematic. We can switch to Take 2 by select it from this menu. 

1.	**Double-click** on the **Shot0002_003** to open it, then **Left-click** drag to select and delete each of the keyframes within it. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_12.png)

	We are going to change the current camera movement to a different motion for this take. 

1.	Lock the Viewport to the camera, the move it in near the character's face and press **S** to keyframe the position. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_14.png)

1.	In the **Details** panel for the camera, adjust the **Manual Focus Distance** then add a keyframe for the adjusted value. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_15.png)

1.	Jump to the end of the sequence, the move the camera back away from the character and keyframe it. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_16.png)

1.	Click the **Master** breadcrumb to return to the **Master** Track. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_17.png)


## End Result

You should now have a two shot cinematic, however you can use different **Takes** from the Take Menu.

You can also re-arrange the Shots by dragging them to new locations on the Shot Track. You can also add a Take as an additional Shot, giving you three Shots. 
While this is only a small fraction of what is possible with Sequencer, it highlights some of the core aspects of the tool that you can use to craft your scenes. 

In the next and final step, you will find some "On Your Own" challenges you can attempt to add to this scene and links to additional documentation.
