Now that you have created a sample cinematic with Sequencer, you can try several of the How-to's to add to this scene. 

Try some of the following on your own: 

* Try to fade the scene in/out use a [**Fade Track**](Engine/Sequencer/HowTo/TracksFade). 
* Make the Character in the level walk using more [**Character Animation**](Engine/Sequencer/HowTo/CharacterAnimation).
* Add Music from the **Content/StarterContent/Audio** folder with an [**Audio Track**](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksAudio). 
* Add a [**Crane**](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\CameraRigCrane) or [**Rail**](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\CameraRigRail) shot to the scene. 
* Cause the scene to enter slow motion with the [**Play Rate**](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksPlayRate) track.
