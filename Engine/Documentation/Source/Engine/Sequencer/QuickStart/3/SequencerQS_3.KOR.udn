In the previous step we added a camera and provided a path for our camera to take. 
Up next we will replace the Character Blueprint that is used with the template with a **Skeletal Mesh** Actor that we can apply animations to. 
By the end of this step, our first shot will be complete. 

## Steps

1. In the **Content Browser**, navigate to the **Content/Mannequin/Character/Mesh** folder and click on **SK_Mannequin**.

1. In the left Viewport, **Right-click** on the character in the level then select **Replace Selected Actors with** option.

	This will replace the default **Character Blueprint** used for gameplay with a **Skeletal Mesh Actor**. 

1.	In the left Viewport, press the **End** key to drop the Skeletal Mesh down to the ground, then press **E** and rotate it as shown below.

1.	With the Skeletal Mesh still selected, in **Sequencer** click the **Add** button and it to the Level Sequence.

1.	For the **ThirdPersonCharacter** Track, click the **+ Animation** button and search for and add the **ThirdPersonIdle**.

	The Skeletal Mesh in the level will assume an Idle pose. 

1.	**Left-click** and drag the end of the **ThirdPersonIdle** so it loops and fills the entire 150 frames.

1.	On the **Camera Cuts** track, click the **Unlock/Lock Camera** button.

	Locking the Camera on a Camera Cuts track, will only affect Cinematic Viewports. 

1.	Click the **Preview Play** button in the Cinematic Preview window.
