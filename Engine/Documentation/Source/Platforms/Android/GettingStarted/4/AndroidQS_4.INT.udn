In the following section we will be taking a look at how you can deploy a single level from the project you are working in to your Android device for quick testing. 

%Steps%

[region:note]
For this section to work you will need to make sure that your Android device is plugged into your development PC via USB. If you have not done this already please do this before going any further.

To deploy your level to your Android device you need to determine which type of Texture format your Android Device supports.
This is because different types of Android devices require different types of Texture formats to work correctly. 
The chart below shows you which Texture formats work with which Android based devices.

[INCLUDE:Platforms/Android/Reference#androidformats]

[REGION:tip]
	If you are unsure which Texture format to use or which ones are supported by your device, you can find out by running the game and then doing the following.

	1. Tap the screen with 4 fingers at once, a dialog will pop up.
	1. This dialog is usually used to enter a console command (like `stat fps`), but it will also display the formats that your device supports. 
	1. Once you have that list, you can use that to choose a more ideal type when deploying/packaging.

1.	To test your current level on a Android based device you first need to make sure you have the level you want to test open. 
	From this example we will be using the **ThirdPersonExampleMap** level from the Blueprint based project that was created in the last step.

1.	With the **ThirdPersonExampleMap** now open go to the **Main Toolbar** and next to the **Launch** icon click on the small triangle that displays more options.

1. From the **Launch** menu under the **Devices** section select your Android device from the list by clicking on it.

1. While your level is being launched on your device the progress will be displayed in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. 
 When the project has been successfully deployed to your device you will see a message telling you so.
